# vim: filetype=crontab
#
# Mautic requires a number of crons to be continually run
# Rather than try and make guess on how often they should run
# this will run them constantly.
# 
# Grouping them by their functions makes it so Mautic can continue
# to process out emails and perform other functions, even if segment
# updates take considerbly longer (ours take ~6 hours for a full cycle)
#

# Necessary for conditionals to work, eg: IP checks
SHELL=/bin/bash

# Where do failure emails go
MAILTO=someone@example.com

# All scripts run every minute, but each script will make
# a determination at runtime if it should proceed
# Meaning, it's safe to constantly run them because they won't double-up
# on each other, you can watch the logs to see when they actually begin
# execution, or immediately exit if the same script is already running
